An interactive photocentric storybook.

**Note:** this project was created as a gift. It was developed to be consumed
as a a [self-published Firefox desktop packaged
app](https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace/Options/Packaged_apps). My
personal storybook turned out to be a single-page 111MB with very little
performance optimizations.

A demo package to install is hosted at
[adelheid.ngokevin.com](http://adelheid.ngokevin.com).

The book consists of chapters. A chapter contains:

- title + text
- key image
- background image
- audio
- moments
- images

Adelheid is generated by [wok](http://wok.mythmon.com), a static site
generator.

## Installation

- ```pip install wok```
- ```wok --server --port 12345```

This will generate a site at ```output``` and host it on a toy server. Using
a reverse proxy is recommended as this app is too media-heavy for the toy
server.

## Content

Chapters are defined in ```content/chapter/``` as Markdown files where the
title, text, and key image is specified. We also define a slug, or codename,
for the chapter so we can connect it with moments and images. Chapter audio
is set via the ```song``` YAML attribute pointing to the path of the audio
file.

Moments for a chapter are defined in
```content/chapter/moments/CHAPTER_SLUG/``` as Markdown files where the
```tag``` attribute in the YAML header is set to the slug of the chapter it
will be connected to. Moments also contain a title, text, and key image.

Images for a chapter are placed in ```media/img/chapters/CHAPTER_SLUG/```. They
will automatically be detected in placed in the chapter's image reel.

## Building the Packaged App

Configure the manifests and index.html to point to your domain. Assume we call
the packaged app ```app.zip```.

    wok
    cd output
    cp ../packaged.manifest.webapp .
    zip -r ../app.zip *

Then serve index.html through a web server. You can then go to the page,
install the app with Firefox, and have it run like a desktop app. Note for OSX,
user will have to enable third-party applications in Security & Privacy
settings to be able to launch the application. Other OSes may require similar
actions.
